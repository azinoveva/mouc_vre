# mouc_vre
Multiobjective Unit Commitment Problem for Variable Renewable Networks

## The code is HEAVILY under construction!

### TODO list:
- [ ] Rewrite matrix A5 in "flipped" dimensions
- [ ] Constraints overhaul
- [ ] Second objective (VRE) implementation
- [ ] (big one) Benchmark *gurobi* -- this can be also used later for SeDuMi
- [ ] (even bigger one) Implement for SeDuMi solver
